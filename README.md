# Supervised-Learning-Regression-Model-Development
Predictive model was built using indicator variables on a continuous response variable - birthweights. The following models (OLS regression, Lasso, Bayesian and KNN) were developed to determine the best output for the target variable.

The final output contained the best model type with a training and test gap less than .5, training and testing scores and final model selection.
